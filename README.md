# Systemback

This is a fork of Systemback. The [original project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/systemback) is no longer maintained by the creator.

It's a simple system backup and restore application with extra features.

Systemback makes it easy to create backups of the system, configuration files, and user files. In case of problems you can easily restore the previous state of the system.
